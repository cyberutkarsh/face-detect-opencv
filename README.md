# face-detect-opencv
This a threaded implementation of Face detection using OpenCV 2.4 and Python 2.7. This repo contains source code to detect human faces using the OpenCV HAAR classifiers. I have used multiple HAAR classfiers which will include custom trained classfiers(models) in the future so that we can reach close to 100% accuracy in detecting human faces in a picture. I will also be including a dockerfile soon to set up the environment.
